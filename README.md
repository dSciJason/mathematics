Mathematics for machine learning

### Purpose
Continue to learn and practice the mathematics involved in machine learning, specifically with regards to neural networks. Understanding the mathematics of machine learning unlocks the 'magic box' explaination that those who don't use to explain machine learning. Depending on your current mathematics skillset, the time involved in graining the required skills can take some time. It is worth the time to learn the skills.
