Mathematics for machine learning

### Purpose
Continue to learn and practice the mathematics involved in machine learning, specifically with regards to neural networks. Understanding the mathematics of machine learning unlocks the 'magic box' explaination that those who don't use to explain machine learning. Depending on your current mathematics skillset, the time involved in graining the required skills can take some time. It is worth the time to learn the skills.

### Mathematics involved in machine learning

  There will be a feature system that impacts the ranking of resources, every additional feature will gain its corresponding resource +1 to its ranking.
  Text
  Audio
  Video
  Multiple Examples (more than 2 per topic)
  Interactive Examples
  
  
  
  One way static material (typically printed or audio) will be assigned the weight 0. I don't do the best with this type of material. Complex state material, audio + visual will get a weight of 1. Video with examples are a great way to learn. This coupled with reading is a solid approach.
